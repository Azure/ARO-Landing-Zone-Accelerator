# Deploy Resource group
In this step, the resource group will be created as well as definition of certain environment variables. Feel free to change the values of the environment variable as you see fit but remember to record them.

The steps are to be executed using Azure CLI in Bash. To begin, ensure [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) is installed. 

 For this step, modify the environment variables in the "Scenarios\Secure-Baseline\Azure-CLI\01-requirements\rg.azcli" file as you see fit and execute the commands in that file one at a time in your bash terminal.
