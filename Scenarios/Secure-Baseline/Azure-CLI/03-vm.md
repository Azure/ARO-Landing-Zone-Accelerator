# Deploy VM
In this step, the following resources will be deployed amongst other things:
1. Virtual machine that will be used to access the private cluster
1. Azure Bastion

Execute the code in the "Scenarios\Secure-Baseline\Azure-CLI\03-vm\vm.azcli" file. Please note that there is also the option to use a linux machine with a public IP (commented out) but we suggest you go with the bastion option (uncommented) instead
